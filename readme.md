## How does it work ? ##

- RPG JS is based primarily on data stored in JSON files.
- The project contains a very specific folder structure.
- The engine used is CanvasEngine (last version) for display, collisions, sound, but especially for creating scenes.

The core of RPG JS is composed of three parts:

- Sprites : Display characters and sets the stage
- Games : Contains only data manipulation (no display)
- Scenes : The scenes are the link between the data manipulation and display. It also gets input from the keyboard or joystick
